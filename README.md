## Key Bindings

By default Looking Glass uses the `Scroll Lock` key as the escape key for commands as well as the input capture mode toggle, this can be changed using the `-m` switch if you desire a different key.
Below are a list of current key bindings:

| Command | Description |
|-|-|
| <kbd>ScrLk</kbd>   | Toggle cursor screen capture |
| <kbd>ScrLk</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> | Full Screen toggle |
| <kbd>ScrLk</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> | Spice keyboard & mouse enable toggle |
| <kbd>ScrLk</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> | Cycle through 4 brightness levels (EGL renderer only!) |
